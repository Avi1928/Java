Hacking has been a part of computing for almost five decades and it is a very broad 
discipline, which covers a wide range of topics. The first known event of hacking had taken 
place in 1960 at MIT and at the same time, the term "Hacker" was originated.
Hacking is the act of finding the possible entry points that exist in a computer system or 
a computer network and finally entering into them. Hacking is usually done to gain 
unauthorized access to a computer system or a computer network, either to harm the 
systems or to steal sensitive information available on the computer.
Hacking is usually legal as long as it is being done to find weaknesses in a computer or 
network system for testing purpose. This sort of hacking is what we call Ethical Hacking.
A computer expert who does the act of hacking is called a "Hacker". Hackers are those 
who seek knowledge, to understand how systems operate, how they are designed, and 
then attempt to play with these systems.
